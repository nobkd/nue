# The new standard for web design and development
Form & Function is an example brand created to demonstrate this multi-page application template with placeholder content. The images are simple HTML divs with Bauhaus-inspired colors and the CSS uses an intentionally minimal brutalist approach. Just 4-5kb covers both the content site and a single-page app.

# Built for the present. Ready for the future.
Modern web standards provide everything you need to build fast, accessible, and maintainable digital products.

  **Web standards never expire**, unlike framework APIs that change every few years. HTML from 2006 still works. CSS only grows more powerful. JavaScript remains the language of the web. These skills compound over decades and your products stay fresh without constant rewrites or technical debt accumulation.


  **Performance through simplicity** means faster load times, better user experience, and lower hosting costs. When every piece serves a purpose, your sites become lean and efficient. No unnecessary abstractions, no bloated dependencies, no complex build processes that slow down development cycles.
