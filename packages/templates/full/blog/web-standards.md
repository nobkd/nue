# Web standards never get old
HTML from 2006 still works. CSS only grows more powerful. JavaScript remains the language of the web. Framework APIs change every few years, but web standards compound over decades.

## The framework cycle

Remember when jQuery was essential? Then Backbone became the standard. Angular took over, then React dominated. Each promised to be different, to last longer, to solve problems for good.

The pattern repeats every 3-5 years. New framework emerges. Ecosystem forms around it. Tools multiply. Then something newer appears. The cycle starts again. Developers rewrite applications, learn new APIs, migrate component libraries.

Meanwhile, HTML keeps working. CSS adds new features. JavaScript evolves through standards committees with careful consideration for backwards compatibility. The foundation stays solid while the abstractions churn.

## What survives

Your HTML semantics from 2010 render perfectly in 2025 browsers. Forms work the same way. Navigation works the same way. The `<button>` element still handles clicks, focus, and keyboard navigation automatically.

CSS you wrote before flexbox still works. Grid layout added new possibilities without breaking old code. Custom properties enhanced styling without replacing selectors. Each addition strengthened the language instead of fragmenting it.

JavaScript functions from ES5 run unchanged in modern browsers. ES6 classes didn't break ES5 functions. Async/await didn't deprecate promises. The language grows by addition, not replacement.

## Skills that compound

Framework knowledge expires. How many React developers remember class components? How many know Higher-Order Components? How many still use Redux? Each pattern had its moment, then became legacy code requiring migration.

Web standards knowledge accumulates. Learning CSS grid doesn't obsolete flexbox. Understanding custom properties enhances all CSS work. Mastering semantic HTML improves every project. Each skill reinforces the others.

  **Framework expertise** becomes outdated as new versions change APIs. You relearn patterns, migrate codebases, and update dependencies. The knowledge has a shelf life measured in years.

  **Standards expertise** grows more valuable with time. HTML accessibility principles apply everywhere. CSS layout techniques work in any framework. JavaScript fundamentals transfer across environments.

## Products that last

Applications built on web standards age gracefully. HTML semantics work with future assistive technologies. CSS layouts adapt to new screen sizes. JavaScript modules integrate with whatever comes next.

Framework applications require constant maintenance. Dependencies update. APIs change. Security patches demand code changes. The technical debt accumulates until migration becomes necessary.

When your foundation is standards-based, maintenance focuses on features instead of infrastructure. You add capabilities rather than fixing compatibility. The application improves instead of just surviving.

## The long view

Web standards move slowly by design. Committees debate changes for years. Browser vendors implement carefully. Backwards compatibility gets absolute priority. This deliberate pace creates stability that frameworks can't match.

The web platform in 2025 runs code from 2005 perfectly. Try running a jQuery plugin from 2015 in a modern React app. Try using Angular 1 components in Angular 17. The web survives. The frameworks fragment.

Standards-first development isn't about avoiding modern tools. It's about building on foundations that last. Use frameworks when they add value. But remember what survives when they don't.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aren't going anywhere. Your investment in web standards compounds forever.
