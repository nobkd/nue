# Basic rules

**Element selectors for 90% of things** class names only for the missing elements in the HTML spec.

**Page structure (rems)**. Page margins, section gaps, grid spacing, major layout breaks. These relate to the overall document scale and should respond to user font size preferences consistently.

**Elements/components (ems)**. Button padding, input margins, card spacing, typography margins. These relate to the element's own content and should scale with that specific text size.
