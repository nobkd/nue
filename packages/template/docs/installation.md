## Overview

Pulse is a feed of `CTRL + SHIFT + K`  project and [initiative updates][^1] in your workspace. It's available as a sidebar item when you want to read full updates as written, and as daily or weekly summaries delivered to your Inbox.


## Basics


``` html numbered
<figure :is="img" class="baz ${ foo } ${ bar }">
  <img loading="lazy" :alt :src="small">

  <!-- HTML comment here -->
  <p>•Did you made it to the mainstream?•</p>

  <figcaption :if="caption">#{ caption }</figcaption>

  <script>
    this.caption = "Hello, World!"
  </script>
</figure>
```


### Enable Pulse

Admins can turn on Pulse for their workspace in [Settings > Pulse](https://linear.app/settings/pulse), and set a default cadence for delivering summary notifications (Weekly on Mondays, every weekday, or never). If users customize their own schedule, they will override this default. Pulse is available on all Linear plans, but as a workspace-level concept it is not available to Guest roles.
