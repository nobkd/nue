__The Vision__
# Radically simpler stack
We are building a radically simpler frontend tooling to bring back the joy of web development:

## Phase 1: Simplify frontend engineering (Done/Beta)

A React button shouldn’t outweigh an entire single-page application. Nue fixes this. It allows you to build large-scale apps with a fraction of code. Try it yourself:

```sh
nue create simple-mpa
```

## Phase 2: Fix design engineering

Building a new theme shouldn’t require [40,000+ lines of TSX][new_york]. Nue brings you true design systems with modern CSS. Themes become simple, lightweight layers, giving you full control over typography and whitespace. This arrives later:

```sh
nue create startup --design "Rams"
```

## Phase 3: Redefine full-stack engineering

Applications shouldn’t demand months only to fall short on polish and detail. Nue’s endgame is a system where anyone can have a site with Apple/Stripe-level polish without an engineering team:

```sh
nue create startup --design "Mies" --live
```

## FAQ: Are You Nuts?

Yes, and excited. Let’s break it down with some numbers. The Nue codebase is 8,000 lines of code. Next.js? It’s 1,236,000 lines — 150 times more to maintain.

We don’t need a huge team to proceed and manage things.

Our edge is the radically simpler stack.
