__The Vision__
# A simplified frontend stack
Nue is an ambitious project that rebuilds the entire frontend ecosystem in three distinct phases, each addressing a key problem in today’s mess

![Hero image: Phases and ETAs]


## Phase 1: Fix frontend development
A React button shouldn’t outweigh an entire single-page application. Nue changes this. It helps you build simpler and faster products by working closer to metal. Try it yourself:

```sh
nue create simple-mpa
```


## Phase 2: Rethink design engineering
Building a new theme shouldn’t require 40,000+ lines of TSX. Nue will unlock design engineering. Themes become simple systems, letting you shift from Miesian layouts to Ramsian design in a snap. This arrives later:

```sh
nue create startup --design rams
```


## Phase 3: Simplify full-stack engineering
Applications shouldn’t demand years and special expertise—only to fall short on polish and detail. Nue’s endgame is a system where anyone can build something as refined as Apple or Stripe without a huge engineering team:

```sh
nue create startup --design mies --live
```

## FAQ: Are you nuts?
This kind of ambition might sound crazy, but let’s break it down with some numbers. The Nue codebase is 8,000 lines of code. Next.js? It’s 1,236,000 lines—150 times more to maintain.

We can move fast because we don’t need a huge team to manage things. Minimalism is a strength in development that people often overlook. That’s what gives us a massive edge.
