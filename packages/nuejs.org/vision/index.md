# Nue Vision: Rebuild the Frontend Ecosystem
Nue is a project to rethink web development through three clear phases, each addressing a core problem in the current landscape.

## Phase 1: Rethink Frontend Engineering
A React button shouldn’t outweigh an entire single-page application. Today’s heavy frameworks slow down development, limit flexibility, and stifle real engineering progress.

Nue changes this with a leaner approach. It enables cleaner code and faster builds, freeing developers to focus on function and user experience. Try it yourself:

```sh
nue create simple-mpa
```

## Phase 2: Redefine Design Engineering
Building a new theme shouldn’t require 40,000+ lines of TSX. The current ecosystem forces developers into rigid, bloated workflows that resist creativity and efficiency.

Nue’s next step is true design engineering. Themes become adjustable through settings or light CSS tweaks, letting you shift from minimalist layouts to functional designs or vibrant styles with ease. This arrives later:

```sh
nue create startup --design rams
```

## Phase 3: Reshape Full-Stack Development
Applications shouldn’t demand years, rare expertise, or long deployment times—only to fall short on polish and detail. Nue’s endgame is a system where anyone can build something as refined as Apple or Stripe, without vast resources.

```sh
nue create startup --design mies --live
```

I know this sounds ambitious—maybe even impossible. But the reality is simpler than it seems: strip away the clutter, focus on better choices, and refine what matters. The result will be more powerful than you expect.
