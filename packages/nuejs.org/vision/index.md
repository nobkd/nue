__The Vision__
# Radically simpler stack
Nue is an ambitious project that rebuilds the entire frontend ecosystem in three distinct phases, each addressing a key problem in what went wrong:

## Phase 1: Simplify frontend engineering (Done)
A React button shouldn’t outweigh an entire single-page application. Nue crushes this. It allows you to build large-scale apps with a fraction of code. Try it yourself:

```sh
nue create simple-mpa
```

## Phase 2: Recover design engineering
Building a new theme shouldn’t require [40,000+ lines of TSX][new_york]. Nue brings you true design systems with modern CSS. Themes become simple, lightweight layers, letting you decide and fine-tune the exact look and feel. Nue will fix this problem, even more severe than what the React button reveals. This arrives later:

```sh
nue create startup --design "Rams"
```

## Phase 3: Redefine full-stack engineering
Applications shouldn’t demand months only to fall short on polish and detail. Nue’s endgame is a system where anyone can have a site with Apple/Stripe-level polish without an engineering team:

```sh
nue create startup --design "Mies" --live
```

## FAQ: Are You Nuts?
Yes, and super excited. Let’s break it down with some numbers. The Nue codebase is 8,000 lines of code. Next.js? It’s 1,236,000 lines—150 times more to maintain.

We can move fast because we don’t need a huge team to manage things. Minimalism is a strength in development that people often overlook. That’s our edge.
