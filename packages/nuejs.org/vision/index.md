# Nue Vision: Rebuild the Frontend Ecosystem
Nue is a project that reconstructs the web stack in three distinct phases, each addressing a key problem in the current landscape.

## Phase 1: Rethink Frontend Engineering
A React button shouldn’t outweigh an entire single-page application. Today’s heavy frameworks slow down development, limit flexibility, and stifle real engineering progress.

Nue changes this with a leaner approach. It enables cleaner code and faster builds, freeing developers to focus on function and user experience. Try it yourself:

```sh
nue create simple-mpa
```

## Phase 2: Redefine Design Engineering
Building a new theme shouldn’t require 40,000+ lines of TSX. Development should not be forced into rigid, bloated workflows that resist creativity and precision.

Nue’s next step is to unlock design engineering. Themes become simple systems, letting you shift from Miesian layouts to Ramsian design with ease. This arrives later:

```sh
nue create startup --design rams
```

## Phase 3: Reshape Full-Stack Development
Applications shouldn’t demand years, rare expertise, or long deployment times—only to fall short on polish and detail. Nue’s endgame is a system where anyone can build something as refined as Apple or Stripe, without vast resources.

```sh
nue create startup --design mies --live
```

I know this sounds overly ambitious—almost crazy. But the reality is simpler than it seems: the whole ecosystem might only need code worth of 10 React buttons, and the result will be more influental than you'd expect.
