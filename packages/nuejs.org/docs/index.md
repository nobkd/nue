# Why Nue
Nue is a standards-first framework that maximizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WASM to build ambitious multi-page web applications with radically less code than traditional frameworks.

## Lighter than a React button
Nue redefines lightweight:

Across every metric—project size, build times, HMR speed, dev bundle, production bundle—Nue delivers 10x, 100x, even 1000x gains over the norm.


## More ambitious apps with Rust and WASM
Nue apps use a separated model layer to shatter the limits of traditional frameworks. With **Rust**, for instance, we deliver instant keypress search across 150,000 records—far past where JavaScript chokes on a callstack overflow.

This is the playbook of top-tier apps like **Figma** and **Notion**: a decoupled layer handling the performance-critical work.



## For system engineers
Nue revives the craft of building robust, functional software. It’s built for JS/TS/Rust/Go engineers who prize timeless algorithms and data structures over fleeting trends. With Nue, you create frontend models free from typical UI idioms and patterns, delivering clean, testable code. Experiment with performance algorithms, optimize freely, or shape the data flow—think event sourcing for instant in-memory access.

Nue is for hackers who lean on Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, not React hooks.


## For design engineers
The best UI designs out there are based on a carefully crafted _design system_, where typography, whitespace, and motion are expressed with the clarity and power of modern CSS.

No more TypeScript types, business logic, or utility walls to block the designwork. [40,000-line](//github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/registry/new-york/ui) JSX themes become a thing of the past.

Nue is a perfect system for design engineers, who see the strength in CSS @layers, --variables, and calc() —tools to build intentional, uncompromised interfaces.


## For frontend engineers
Imagine the new reality: building entire applications with the same code footprint as a single React button.

Nue is the fastest way to build ambitious applications that push the web forward.
