# Nue: Truly ambitious web applications
Nue opens entirely new possibilities for differentiation. Build your business model in Rust that processes operations at native speed. Create a data visualization engine with sophisticated WebAssembly computations. Or craft interfaces that command attention through mathematical design system.

Above you see a multi-page application that touches the boundaries of what's possible in the browser: instant keypress search across 50,000 records, seamless view transitions between marketing pages and dynamic interfaces, full-blown state management, a design system tying it all together.


## Smaller than a React button
This isn't just marginally better than a React implementation—it's operating in an entirely different universe of performance and simplicity. Under the hood, Nue takes a fundamentally different approach to web development, achieving a level of performance, flexibility, and architectural clarity that simply isn't possible within the current React ecosystem:



| Dev bundle | 1.6MB | 200kB | 8 times less |
| Production bundle | 317kB | 117kB | Almost 3 times leaner |



## Tooling and development experience
Build times drop from minutes to milliseconds. Hot Module Replacement becomes truly instant—changes appear the moment you save. Development loops tighten: write code, see results, iterate. This is what development should feel like.

| Framework | 98MB, 77+ pieces | 2MB, 5 pieces | 49 times smaller |
| Build time | Around 3 seconds | 90ms | 33 times faster |
| Updates | 100-500ms | 5-50ms | 20 times quicker |




## Maintenance and scalability
The big difference: you need significantly less code to do the same thing. And thanks to separation of concerns, the code is cleaner and standards based — opening new doors to system, design, and UX engineering.

### Systems Engineering
When business logic lives in a pure model layer, entirely new possibilities emerge. You can build sophisticated data engines in Rust, create real-time collaboration systems, or develop complex financial models - all properly isolated from presentation concerns. This is systems programming for the web: ironclad type safety, near-native performance, and properly architected business logic.


### Design Engineering
When conversations shift from state management to systematic design, true design engineering emerges. This vital field returns to those who understand design at its deepest level - not framework patterns, but the mathematical precision that makes interfaces command attention through pure visual relationships.

Instead of 40,000 lines of TypeScript (ShadcnUI's "New York" theme) mixing framework concerns with visual choices, you craft design systems through 1,000 lines of modern CSS. Your code organizes itself around timeless design principles - color harmonies, typographic scales, spatial relationships - not engineering patterns.

### UX Engineering
With attention freed from component hierarchies and prop drilling, you can master the browser's full capabilities: view transitions, container queries, scroll-driven animations. Focus on creating exceptional experiences trough skills, that stand the test of time.

When your view layer consists of 10 focused, semantic files instead of hundreds of monolithic components, development becomes the satisfaction of stripping away unnecessary complexity. Each component serves a clear purpose and nothing more. The complexity vanishes because there's simply less to manage—no state hierarchies to untangle, no prop drilling to trace, no utility classes to maintain.
