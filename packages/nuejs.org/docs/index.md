#### Why Nue
# Apps lighter than a React button
Nue is a standards-first framework that pushes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WASM to their limits. It helps you achieve more with significantly less code:

  class: taller

See benchmark and details [here](react-button-vs-nue.html).

## Extreme performance with Rust and WASM
Nue apps use a separated model layer to shatter the limits of traditional frameworks. This demo uses **Rust** for instant keypress search across 150,000 records—far beyond where JavaScript hits a callstack overflow.

## New levels of HMR and tooling performance
Nue outperforms today’s frameworks across every key metric: project size, build times, HMR speed, codebase size, and bundle sizes.

Build times consistently run in milliseconds, even for large-scale apps, delivering orders of magnitude boosts over traditional tools:

## What this means

### Performance engineering
Nue brings back the good practices of software engineering: simple, testable functions, modular design, minimal dependencies, and a model-first approach. It’s perfect for JS/TS/Rust/Go engineers who value classic algorithms and data structures over odd React idioms. You can build products with new levels of performance and clarity.

### Design engineering
Building a new theme shouldn’t require [40,000+ lines of TSX][new_york]. Instead, you’ll craft a design system with modern CSS using @layers, variables, and calc(). You shift from React engineering to design engineering and start thinking about design topics like typographic scales and whitespace consistency.

### UX engineering
Imagine building entire applications with the same code footprint as a single React button, focusing solely on the user experience. Nue is the easiest way to build large-scale applications that push the web (and your skills) forward.


## What’s next
Nue is an ambitious project that reshapes the entire frontend ecosystem:
