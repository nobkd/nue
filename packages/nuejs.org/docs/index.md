# Why Nue
Nue is a standards-first framework that pushes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WASM to theri limit. It helps you build ambitious web applications with radically less code than with traditional frameworks.

## Lighter than a React button
Nue redefines lightweight:

Across every metric—project size, build times, HMR speed, dev bundle, production bundle—Nue delivers 10x, 100x, even 1000x gains over the norm.


## More ambitious apps with Rust and WASM
Nue apps use a separated model layer to shatter the limits of traditional frameworks. With **Rust**, for instance, we deliver instant keypress search across 150,000 records—far past where JavaScript chokes on a callstack overflow.

This is the playbook of top-tier apps like **Figma** and **Notion**: a decoupled layer handling the performance-critical work.



## For system engineers
Nue brings back the skill of making strong, working software. It’s made for JS/TS/Rust/Go engineers who value classic algorithms and data structures over fancy frontend trends. Nue gives you clean, testable code. You can try out performance tweaks or adjust the data setup—like event sourcing for quick in-memory access.

Nue is for business model hackers who lean on Gang of Four (GoF) patterns, not React hooks.


## For design engineers
The best UI designs out there are based on a carefully crafted _design system_, where typography, whitespace, and motion are expressed with the clarity and power of modern CSS.

Nue is for design engineers, who see the strength in CSS @layers, --variables, and calc(), not in [40,000-line](//github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/registry/new-york/ui) JSX themes.


## For frontend engineers
Imagine the new reality: building entire applications with the same code footprint as a single React button.

Nue is the fastest way to build ambitious applications that push the web forward.
