# The Solution: Standards First
Picture a multi-page app, a WASM-powered search on keypress, smooth view transitions, in-memory records via event sourcing, full-blown state management, a design system tying it all together. That’s 117kB. Not just better than React. It's a whole new game.

Nue leans on what the web already gives us—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Kept simple and close. Here’s how it sits next to React:

| Metric | React | Nue | Difference |
|--------|-------|-----|------------|
| UI files | Over 100 | 10 | 10 times fewer |
| UI code | 2,000+ lines | 200 lines | 10 times lighter |
| Framework | 98MB, 77+ pieces | 2MB, 5 pieces | 49 times smaller |
| App extras | 65MB, 100+ pieces | Nothing extra | No add-ons |
| Dev bundle | 1.6MB | 200kB | 8 times less |
| Final size | 317kB | 117kB | Almost 3 times leaner |
| Build time | Around 3 seconds | 90ms | 33 times faster |
| Updates | 100-500ms | 5-50ms | 20 times quicker |

React 1.0 started with a good idea of being just the view layer. Nue builds on that foundation, staying close to the web standards.


### Simplicity
You work with ten files. Not a hundred. Each one feels straightforward. A button is  a button, not a JavaScript maze. There’s not much to keep track of. You can build something real without all the extra weight. The complexity vanishes because there's simply less to think about.


### Developer Experience
Simple, modular components transform how you work. Build times drop from minutes to milliseconds. Hot Module Replacement becomes truly instant—changes appear the moment you save. Development loops tighten: write code, see results, iterate. This is what development should feel like.



## New Career Paths
With Nue you can master specific disciplines that push web development forward:


- **Systems Engineering**: When business logic lives in a pure model layer, entirely new possibilities emerge. You can build sophisticated data engines in Rust, create real-time collaboration systems, or develop complex financial models - all properly isolated from presentation concerns. This is systems programming for the web: ironclad type safety, near-native performance, and properly architected business logic.

- **Design Engineering**: Instead of 40,000 lines of TypeScript (ShadcnUI's "New York" theme) mixing framework concerns with visual choices, you craft design systems through 1,000 lines of modern CSS. Your code organizes itself around timeless design principles - color harmonies, typographic scales, spatial relationships - not engineering patterns.

- **UX Engineering**: With attention freed from component hierarchies and prop drilling, you can master the browser's full capabilities: view transitions, container queries, scroll-driven animations. Focus on creating exceptional experiences trough skills, that stand the test of time.


## Market opportunities
In the React ecosystem, products tend look and feel the same. Every application uses the same component libraries, follows identical patterns, ships similar bundles of JavaScript. Innovation becomes harder and harder.

Nue opens entirely new possibilities for differentiation. Build a vector editing engine in Rust that processes operations at native speed. Create a data visualization platform with sophisticated WebAssembly computations. Craft interfaces that command attention through mathematical precision rather than component libraries. Or establish a digital agency that delivers products with exceptional performance and design clarity.

With Nue you can build products that stand apart through superior engineering, design precision, and exceptional performance. This is where true product innovation happens.
