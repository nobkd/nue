Let’s see what you can do by taking the modern web standards — HTML, CSS, and JS — to their absolute peak:

This large-scale application, with all the necessary features, is significantly lighter than a single React button:

Here’s the same app, now with a **Rust** computation engine and **Event Sourcing** for instant search and other operations over **150,000** records — far past where JavaScript (and React) would crash with a stack overflow error:

Let’s take a look under the hood:

Nue shatters the limits of frontend tooling: HMR hits instantly, build times take milliseconds — even for large apps. This immediate feedback loop boosts day-to-day experience and productivity.

**This is a wake-up call:**


### For performance engineers
Nue is a wake-up call for performance engineers stuck wrestling React patterns instead of chasing real gains. It brings simple, testable functions, modular design, minimal dependencies, and a model-first approach — best for JS/TS/Rust/Go devs whose skills shine under solid frontend architecture.

### For design engineers
Nue is a wake-up call for design engineers bogged down by React patterns instead of shaping the design itself. Ditch [40,000+ lines of TSX][new_york] — build lean systems with modern CSS (@layers, variables, calc()) and own your typography and whitespace.

### For UX engineers
Nue is a wake-up call for UX engineers tangled in React hooks and utility walls instead of owning the user experience. Build apps as light as a React button to push the web — and your skills — forward.
