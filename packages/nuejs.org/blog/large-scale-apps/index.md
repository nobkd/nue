On this release we're showing what you can do by taking the modern web standards — HTML, CSS, and JS — to their absolute peak:

The entire app is significantly lighter than a React button:

## Scaling up
Here’s the same app, now with a **Rust** computation engine and **Event Sourcing** for instant search and other operations over **150,000** records — far past where JavaScript (and React) would crash with a stack overflow error:

## Tooling
Nue crushes HMR and build speed records and sets you up with a millisecond feedback loop for your day-to-day VSCode/Sublime file-save operations:

**This is a wake-up call:**


### For performance engineers
Nue is a wake-up call for performance engineers stuck wrestling React patterns instead of chasing real gains. It brings simple, testable functions, modular design, minimal dependencies, and a model-first approach — best for JS/TS/Rust/Go devs whose skills shine under solid frontend architecture.

### For design engineers
Nue is a wake-up call for design engineers bogged down by React patterns instead of shaping the design itself. Ditch [40,000+ lines of TSX][new_york] — build lean systems with modern CSS (@layers, variables, calc()) and own your typography and whitespace.

### For UX engineers
Nue is a wake-up call for UX engineers tangled in React hooks and utility walls instead of owning the user experience. Build apps as light as a React button to push the web — and your skills — forward.


## FAQ: WTH is Nue?
Nue is a web framework focused on web standards, currently in active development. Our goal is to expose the hidden complexity that's become standard in modern web development. When a single button weighs more than an entire application, something is undeniably broken.

Nue makes the inevitable shift. We're rebuilding the entire ecosystem from scratch, with a cleaner, more efficient architecture. We're restoring the joy of web development for all key skillsets: frontend architects, design engineers, and UX engineers.
