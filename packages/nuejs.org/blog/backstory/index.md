title: Because web development used to be *FUN!*
desc: Why I'm building a complete frontend ecosystem from scratch

I still remember the exact moment when I discovered **jQuery**. It was a revelation: Can I suddenly add logic to my pages in the same way I add styling? I surely can — this must be huge!

And it was: In the following years we got introduced to groundbreaking concepts like **separation of concerns**, **progressive enhancement**, and **responsive web design**. Things were great.


## Then it changed { #then }

Developers discovered **React** and single-page applications. **Facebook** took over. Slowly but steadily **JavaScript** took control of everything. Layout, styling, and business logic were bundled together. CSS was ditched in the name of "global namespace pollution" and content-heavy websites were developed like they were single-page apps. Eventually, JS engineers won, [UX developers][divide] lost, and the old foundation was gone.


## Nue brings the fun back { #magic }
Nue brings perfromance-, degsign-, and UX engineering back to the forefront. What used to take  an absurd amount of TypeScript/TSX can now be done with a fraction of the code, your codebases look clean, and the results are leaner. You begin to wonder why you ever built website any other way.

### Peace ❤️
