## Standards first web framework
Nue is a standards first web framework that returns web development back to its core strengths. It takes modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to their natural peaks without introducing unnecessary abstractions.

It is based on the following foundations:

1. **Standards first**: Browsers have evolved significantly in the past decade. By working with the standards rather than against them, we create better products with less code.

2. **HTML first**: semantic HTML is the foundation for everything: layouts, server components, and interactive islands. The same syntax and mental model is better for developers, search engines, and screen readers.

3. **Content first**: Rich Markdown syntax handles everything from marketing to documentation. Content lives in clean, accessible files — not in JavaScript.

4. **Design systems**: modern, systematic CSS is more powerful than you think. Learn to build design systems, and you'll get better interfaces with less code.

Here's what this enables:

1. **Faster HMR and tooling**: Instant (below 50ms) content, style, data, and component updates. It feels different.

2. **Cleaner code**: No TypeScript imports, no utility classes, no state management complexity. Just clean, minimalistic code that naturally separates content, structure, and styling.

3. **Faster pages**: The fastest page load is one that requires just a single request. No framework initialization, no cumulative layout shifts, no waiting for JavaScript. When content and styling arrive together, pages simply appear.

## Who is Nue good for?

Nue is a great fit for:

1. **Beginner web developers**: Those looking to bypass [frontend redundancy](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and work directly with the Web Standard Model: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Experienced JavaScript developers**: Those frustrated with the overwhelming amount of abstractions in the [React stack](https://roadmap.sh/react) and seeking simpler ways to develop professional websites.

3. **Design-focused teams**: Those prioritizing user experience and design systems, leveraging modern CSS to create efficient, lightweight websites that enhance usability without the bloat of JS monoliths.
