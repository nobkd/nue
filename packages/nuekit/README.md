# The UNIX of the Web
Web development became complicated. Hundreds of packages, 400MB of dependencies, hours of configuration before writing a single line of code. We forgot that it doesn't have to be this way.


## How web development should work

**Instant start** - Create `index.html` or `index.md` and you're running. No setup, no configuration, no waiting.

**Single-page apps** - Write semantic HTML with dynamic expressions. Import business logic from pure JavaScript modules. Let your design system handle presentation.

**Content sites** - Front pages, documentation, blogs, marketing pages. Write Nuemark content, add layout modules for structure, trust your design system for consistency.

**Universal hot reload** - Content, CSS, layouts, data, components, server routes, configurations. Save and watch the browser update instantly.

**Complete system** - Content sites, SPAs, server routes, backend models.

One tool, complete control. The UNIX philosophy applied to web development.

**Nue is the entire ecosystem in 1MB**

## Migration from React/Next.js

**Less scaffolding** - From 500MB+ of node_modules to 1MB global install. From complex project setups to just `index.html` to get started.

**Pure separation** - Business logic in JS modules. Structure in HTML. Design in CSS. No more mixed concerns in components.

**Faster everything** - Builds in milliseconds. Hot reload across frontend and backend. Pages 10x smaller.
