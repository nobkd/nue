# nueyaml

YAML without the problems.

**⚠️ Internal use only** — This project is not yet officially launched and is currently used within the Nue ecosystem.

## What is nueyaml?

A cleaner, simpler approach to YAML that fixes the common pain points developers face with traditional YAML syntax. Built with the same standards-first philosophy as Nue — less complexity, more clarity.

## Why nueyaml?

YAML was supposed to be human-readable, but it became a source of frustration:

- Indentation errors that break everything
- Inconsistent boolean handling
- Complex multiline string syntax
- Surprising type coercion
- Poor error messages

nueyaml solves these problems while keeping the good parts of structured data.
