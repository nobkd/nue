# Minimalism
**Less is More.** This simple idea changed architecture forever. Rather than adding more ornament, more decoration, more complexity, Mies van der Rohe leaned on universal building blocks that could deliver simple, beautiful, timeless spaces.
Web development needs the same revolution.

Instead of adding more layers, more libraries, more API methods, we need better ways to reach elegant, lasting solutions. Just like Mies found the essential elements—steel, glass, open space—that could create any building, Nue takes the core web standards—HTML, CSS, JavaScript—to create uncompromising results.

## Less is More:

### Lean stack
1MB. Everything you need. Nothing you don't.

### Less to learn
Become a master in week. Learn skills that last forever.

### Easier to scale
Build products that remain simple as the complexity grows.

### Faster builds
Your site is already built as you release the enter key.

### Snappier apps
Ship a complete SPA smaller than a single React button.

### Creative power
Assemble complex apps with simple, universal building blocks.


> So einfach wie möglich, koste es, was es wolle.
As simple as possible, whatever the cost
