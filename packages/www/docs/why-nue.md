# Why Nue

Nue liberates developers from massive monoliths to architectural sanity. It makes web development simple, efficient, and fun.

## Standards first

React emerged in 2013 to make HTML "reactive." It was elegant at first—a focused library solving a real problem. But then it went on its own trajectory, putting everything into the same massive component, turning everything into JavaScript. The simple idea turned into a sprawling monolith. It started solving problems it created.

Meanwhile, the web evolved. The web in 2025 is a whole different beast than what it was in 2013. HTML can describe complex applications. CSS creates true design systems. JavaScript turned ES6—almost a new language.

Nue starts from Web 2025 and elevates it to maximum potential. Nue adds what's missing while preserving what works. It's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript taken to their absolute peak.

## The UNIX of the Web

Nue is the entire web ecosystem in 1MB. A complete web application builder from content-focused apps to ambitious single-page applications. It's high-level tooling for a wide range of full-stack applications. It's a low-level framework that runs identically on your machine and across 200+ edge locations.

It's a massive contrast to today's 300MB frameworks with hundreds of NPM dependencies and an insane amount of abstractions for you to glue together. Nue eliminates entire categories of problems. It's like moving from Windows 95 to modern UNIX.

It does one thing and does it well.

## New performance tier

Nue brings you to a new performance tier. It beats your current framework in every metric that matters:

Build times take ~20ms with Nue versus 20+ seconds with Next.js. HMR takes ~10ms versus 1+ seconds. You get single-page applications with the size of a React button.

Remove the framework tax, stay closer to the metal, and reach completely different performance levels.

## Standards are forever

React's tragedy is technical debt. Remember Redux? CSS-in-JS? Class components? Hook dependencies? Each solving problems that exist in React only, now forgotten and replaced with the next hot thing. Skills you learn today become obsolete in 2-3 years.

Web standards have been rock solid for decades. HTML knowledge from 2006 still works perfectly. A carefully crafted CSS design system spans multiple projects and stays relevant forever. Browser APIs don't break with framework updates.

Learn timeless skills from MDN, not third-party corners of the internet. Your investment in standards compounds. Framework knowledge dies.

Standards are the most powerful development platform ever created. Nue makes them shine.
