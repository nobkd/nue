# Why Nue

**Modern web development chose complexity. We chose standards.**

When a single button weighs 79KB and your "hello world" requires 300MB of dependencies, the industry has lost it. We're spiraling under layers of abstraction, solving problems we created.

Meanwhile, the web evolved. HTML describes rich applications. CSS creates systematic design. JavaScript became a mature language. Nue liberates this nextlevel potential.

It's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript taken to their absolute peak.


## The UNIX of the Web
Nue does one thing and does it perfectly. Like UNIX tools that compose beautifully, Nue gives you focused, powerful primitives that scale infinitely.

**1MB** Your entire development environment for full-stack applications working on the edge. Everything you need. Nothing you don't.


### New performance tier
Nue destroys your current framework in every metric that matters:

**Build times**: Your site is already built as you release the enter key.

**Bundle sizes**: Complete SPAs smaller than React buttons.

**HMR speed**: Your content is domdiffed as you hit save.

Just try it and see yourself!


## Standards are forever
Remember jQuery? Angular? Redux? Class components? Your skills expire every 2-3 years.

But standards are forever. HTML knowledge from 2006 still works perfectly. A CSS design system spans decades and multiple projects. Standards are the most powerful development platform ever created.

Learn timeless skills and build products that stands the test of time.
