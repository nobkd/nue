# Why Nue
Nue liberates developers from monolithic components to architectural sanity. It changes the way you think about web development.


## The React trap
React emerged in 2013 to make HTML "reactive." It was elegant at first—a focused library solving a real problem. But then it grew beyond its original purpose, absorbing everything into components, turning every concern into JavaScript. The simple idea became a sprawling monolith.

Meanwhile, the web evolved dramatically. The web in 2025 has capabilities that didn't exist in 2013. HTML can describe complex applications. CSS creates real design systems. JavaScript became ES6—practically a new language. Browser APIs handle what once required libraries.

React stayed on its own path, ignoring these advances. For Nue, the modern web is the starting point. We take HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to their absolute peak.


## The UNIX of the Web
React started small and focused—the first version was just the view layer. But then it went on a trajectory nobody could foresee. The ecosystem grew into a mountain of packages beyond anything imaginable. Today, a Next.js project created with `create-next-app` weighs 427MB just to display "Hello, World." That's eight times the size of Windows 95.

Nue draws inspiration from a completely different source: the UNIX operating system. UNIX commands do one thing well and work together seamlessly. Nue follows the same philosophy: zero external dependencies, every piece handcrafted to integrate perfectly, all focused on delivering the absolute best developer experience.

The result is remarkable: a complete **full-stack development environment in 1MB**. That includes content-focused apps, single-page applications, server-side rendering, hot reloading, syntax highlighting, CloudFlare compatible local dev environment with SQL database, KV database, and more. You'd need both Next.js and Astro to get even close to the feature set.


### New performance tier
When every piece is carefully designed to work together, Nue can operate at a completely different performance tier:

**Build times** drop from 10+ seconds to 100 milliseconds. **Hot reload** happens in 10ms instead of taking seconds. **Bundle sizes** shrink so dramatically that entire single-page applications weigh less than individual React components.

This changes everything. You get instant feedback loops, dramatically less complexity, fewer bugs, easier debugging with thinner stack traces, and easier to maintain products.


## Standards are forever
The biggest tragedy in React is technical debt. Remember Redux? Higher-Order Components? Class components? Enzyme? Each solving problems that exist in the monolith only, now forgotten and replaced with the next trend. Skills you learn today risk becoming obsolete in 2-3 years.

Web standards persist. HTML from 2006 still works. CSS only grows more powerful. JavaScript remains the language of the web. These skills compound over decades.

Products built on standards remain fresh forever. Your investment in web fundamentals never expires.
