# Why Nue
Nue liberates developers from large monolithic components to architectural sanity. It makes web development simple, efficient, and fun.


## Standards first
React emerged in 2013 to make HTML "reactive." It was elegant at first—a focused library solving a real problem. But then it went on its own trajectory, putting everything into the same component, turning everything into JavaScript. The simple idea turned into a growing monolith solving problems it created.

Meanwhile, the web has evolved. The web in 2025 is quite different from 2013. HTML can describe complex applications. CSS creates true design systems. JavaScript became ES6—almost a new language.

Nue starts from Web 2025 and elevates it to maximum potential. It preserves what works and adds what's missing. It's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript taken to their absolute peak.


## The UNIX of the Web
Nue is the entire web ecosystem in 1MB. A complete application builder for everything from content-focused sites to ambitious single-page applications. High-level tooling with low-level control that runs identically on your machine and across 200+ edge locations.

Compare this to today's 300MB frameworks with hundreds of dependencies. Nue eliminates entire categories of problems. It's like moving from Windows 95 to a set of focused UNIX commands.


## New performance tier
Nue helps you reach new performance levels:

- **Build times**: ~20ms
- **HMR**: ~10ms
- **Bundle size**: Complete SPA smaller than a React button


## Standards are forever
React's tragedy is technical debt. Remember Redux? Higher-Order Components? Class components? Enzyme? Each solving problems that exist in the monolith only, now forgotten and replaced with the next trend. Skills you learn today typically become obsolete in 2-3 years.

Web standards persist. HTML from 2006 still works. CSS only grows more powerful. JavaScript remains the language of the web. These skills compound over decades.

More importantly: your standards first products remain fresh forever. Your investment in web fundamentals never expires.
