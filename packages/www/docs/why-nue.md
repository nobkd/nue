# Why Nue
Nue liberates developers from massive monoliths to architectural sanity. It makes web development simple, efficient, and fun.


## Standards first
React emerged in 2013 to make HTML "reactive." It was elegant at first—a focused library solving a real problem. But then it went on its own trajectory, putting everything into the same massive component, turning everything into JavaScript. The simple idea turned into a sprawling monolith solving problems it created.

Meanwhile, the web evolved. The web in 2025 is completely different from 2013. HTML can describe complex applications. CSS creates true design systems. JavaScript became ES6—almost a new language.

Nue starts from Web 2025 and elevates it to maximum potential. It adds what's missing while preserving what works. It's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript taken to their absolute peak.

## The UNIX of the Web
Nue is the entire web ecosystem in 1MB. A complete application builder for everything from content-focused sites to ambitious single-page applications. High-level tooling with low-level control that runs identically on your machine and across 200+ edge locations.

Compare this to today's 300MB frameworks with hundreds of dependencies. Nue eliminates entire categories of problems. It's like moving from Windows to UNIX.


## New performance tier
Remove the framework tax and reach completely different performance levels:

- **Build times**: ~20ms with Nue vs 20+ seconds with Next.js
- **HMR**: ~10ms vs 1+ seconds
- **Bundle size**: Complete SPAs smaller than React buttons


## Standards are forever
React's tragedy is technical debt. Remember Redux? CSS-in-JS? Class components? Each solved problems that existed only in React, now forgotten and replaced with the next hot thing. Skills you learn today become obsolete in 2-3 years.

Web standards have been rock solid for decades. HTML knowledge from 2006 still works perfectly. A carefully crafted CSS design system spans multiple projects and stays relevant forever.

Learn timeless skills from MDN, not framework corners of the internet. Your investment in standards compounds. Framework knowledge dies.

Standards are the most powerful development platform ever created. Nue makes them shine.
