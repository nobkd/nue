# Contributing
I'm **Tero Piirainen**, Nue's creator. Here's how I work and the best ways to contribute.

## Work in bursts
I work in bursts. This means occasional gaps in community responses, delayed pull request reviews, and periods of radio silence. Progress might look slow from the outside, but I'm working constantly.

### According to roadmap
The roadmap is now well-defined: multi-site development, Nue Edge deployment platform, and professional templates with design systems. The wild pivots of early development are behind us.


### Vision is important
I maintain strong opinions about Nue's direction, especially around separation of concerns and web standards. This can make contributing to core architecture challenging. I'm protective of the principles that make Nue different from other frameworks.

## Best ways to help

### Spread the word
Perhaps the most valuable contribution is showing people how web standards are more powerful than frameworks. Write blog posts, create tutorials, share your experiences on Nue.

### Documentation and examples
Help others understand Nue by improving documentation with illustrative examples. Real-world use cases are valuable.

### Bug reports and testing
Test Nue in your projects. Report issues with clear reproduction steps.


## Getting involved
For code contributions, reach out on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nuejs/shared_invite/zt-2wf8ozu5i-N2Y9PA_D17weIWuN2QPOqQ) first. Discuss your idea before writing code. This saves time and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's direction.

Looking forward to building the future of web development together.
