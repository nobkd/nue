# Contributing
I'm **Tero Piirainen** and Nue is my vision for where web development should go. Nue grew from years of frustration with the current state of things.

## How I work
I work in bursts. This means gaps in community responses, delayed pull request reviews, and radio silence. Progress might look slow from the outside, but I'm working constantly.

### Plans change
I've talked about templates being next, then suddenly shipped "Apps lighter than a React button" or announced Nuekit 2.0—something completely different. The roadmap shifts when I discover better approaches. What feels logical today might not be tomorrow.

### Vision matters
I maintain strong opinions about Nue's direction. This can make contributing to core architecture challenging. I'm protective of the vision that drives everything. Think benevolent dictator model.


## Best ways to help
The most valuable contribution isn't code—it's spreading the word. Showing how web standards are more powerful than frameworks.


### Getting involved
For core contributions, reach out on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nuejs/shared_invite/zt-2wf8ozu5i-N2Y9PA_D17weIWuN2QPOqQ) first. Propose your idea. Let's talk through how it fits the vision.

Looking forward to building the future of web development together.
