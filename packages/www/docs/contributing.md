# Contributing
I'm **Tero Piirainen**, Nue's creator. Here's how I work and the best ways to contribute.

## How I work
I work in focused bursts. This means occasional gaps in community responses, delayed pull request reviews, and periods of radio silence. Progress might look slow from the outside, but I'm working constantly.

### Clear roadmap ahead
The roadmap is now well-defined: multi-site development, Nue Edge deployment platform, and professional templates with design systems. The wild pivots of early development are behind us.


### Vision matters
I maintain strong opinions about Nue's direction, especially around separation of concerns and web standards. This can make contributing to core architecture challenging. I'm protective of the principles that make Nue different from other frameworks.

## Best ways to help

### Spread the word
The most valuable contribution isn't code - it's showing people how web standards are more powerful than frameworks. Write blog posts, create tutorials, share your experiences migrating from React or Next.js.

### Documentation and examples
Help others understand Nue by improving documentation, creating examples, or writing migration guides. Real-world use cases are valuable.

### Bug reports and testing
Test Nue in your projects. Report issues with clear reproduction steps.


## Getting involved
For code contributions, reach out on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nuejs/shared_invite/zt-2wf8ozu5i-N2Y9PA_D17weIWuN2QPOqQ) first. Discuss your idea before writing code. This saves time and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's direction.

Looking forward to building the future of web development together.
