# Contributing
Nue is my personal vision for where web development should go. I'm **Tero Piirainen**, and this framework grew from years of frustration with the current state of things. The vision and implementation are mine, but I've had incredible help from **@nobkd** (a legend I've never met—thanks, mate!) and contributors like **Mauricio Wolff, Alan Hemmings**, and many others who've jumped in.


## How I work
I tackle Nue in focused bursts, always chasing the next breakthrough. This means gaps in community responses, delayed pull request reviews, and sometimes radio silence while I'm deep in solving core problems. Progress might look slow from the outside, but there's intense work happening locally. I'm laser-focused on getting the standards-first foundation right.


## Plans change
I've talked about templates being next, then suddenly shipped "Apps lighter than a React button" or announced Nuekit 2.0—something completely different. The roadmap shifts when I discover better approaches. What feels logical today might not be tomorrow. That's the nature of building something genuinely different.


## Vision matters
I maintain strong opinions about Nue's direction. This can make contributing to core architecture challenging—I'm protective of the vision that drives everything. Think benevolent dictator model.


## Best ways to help
The most valuable contribution right now isn't code—it's spreading the standards-first message. Write blog posts. Build demos. Show how native browser features can replace framework complexity. Prove that modern web standards are powerful enough for real applications.

When you see developers fighting CSS-in-JS or wrestling with component hydration, show them a better way. Share examples. Start conversations. The web development community needs to rediscover what browsers can do natively.


## Getting involved
For core contributions, reach out on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nuejs/shared_invite/zt-2wf8ozu5i-N2Y9PA_D17weIWuN2QPOqQ) first. Propose your idea. Let's talk through how it fits the vision.

Looking forward to building the future of web development together.
