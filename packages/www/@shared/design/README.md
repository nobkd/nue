- **Page structure (rems)**. Page margins, section gaps, grid spacing, major layout breaks. These relate to the overall document scale and should respond to user font size preferences consistently.

- **grid.css** for flex, grid, and columned layouts


- Padding with modifiers, margin with grid/flex gaps
