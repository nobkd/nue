# Basic rules

- **Native HTML for 90% of things** custom components (with class names) for missing elements in the HTML spec.

- **Page structure (rems)**. Page margins, section gaps, grid spacing, major layout breaks. These relate to the overall document scale and should respond to user font size preferences consistently.

- **Elements/components (ems)**. Button padding, input margins, card spacing, typography margins. These relate to the element's own content and should scale with that specific text size.
