# Nue
HTML-first markup for building reactive interfaces.

Nue is a templating system that keeps you close to web standards. Instead of abstracting HTML away, it enhances what you already know - letting you build dynamic interfaces while keeping markup, styling, and logic properly separated. Think of it as templating that stays HTML. You write actual HTML and SVG, add reactive behavior where needed, and maintain clean separation between structure, presentation, and logic.

Formerly known as "nuejs" and "hyper", now simplified to just "nue" - representing the core philosophy of HTML-first development without the complexity.
